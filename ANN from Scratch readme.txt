The Notebook contains the following:

1. . Implemented a single layer neural network for regression. Write
backpropagation from scratch for this case in order to work for an
arbitrary number of neurons in the hidden layers.

2. hyperparameter optimization to determine the appropriate
number of neurons.

3. Pytorch implementation of the ANN for the same task.
